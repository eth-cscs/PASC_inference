LOGIN
- connect to ELA machine (the access point to CSCS machines), use riGht password
ssh pospisil@ela.cscs.ch
- from ELA connect to DAINT machine (this machine has GPUs)
ssh daint
- clone repo from git
git clone https://github.com/lukaspospisil/minlin.git
  or update if the repo has been already cloned
git pull
- load right modules using script in "util" folder 
source module_load_daint
(using "source" command, if I run it as a shell script then modules will be loaded only in this script)
- or see available modules using
module avail
 and then load it using
module load ..

COMPILATION
- in folder "examples_cmake" create new folder "build" and call cmake
cmake -DUSE_GPU=ON ..
- now the makefile is generated, therefore compile project using
make
- if there is a problem with cmake, delete folder "build" and start again
rm -rf build

RUN
- on DAINT machine, there is SLURM installed
sbucheck - see our computation budget
sinfo - info about avaiable partitions
sbatch - submit a batch script
squeue - check the status of jobs on the system (squeue --account=c11)
scancel - delete one of your jobs from the queue
- to start interactive session, use
salloc -N 1 --account=c11 --partition=normal
- control connected GPUs using
aprun nvidia-smi -L
- run the program using
aprun -n 1 -d 8 ./program
